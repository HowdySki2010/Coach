What do I want this to do?

For a build
1. Build a plan:
    1. Start with a weekly TSS.
    2. Build out an optimal week from that TSS
    3. Build out intensity workouts in those weeks.
2. Adapt the plan
    1. If a workout is missed, rearrange the weekly TSS distribution
    2. If too much is missed, drop the weekly TSS and rearrange the week
    3. If you have to drop the weekly TSS, then you re-do the upcoming weekly TSS progression
    4. If you miss a key workout, you refactor the week in one way
    5. If you miss a regular workout, you refactor the week in a different way.
3. Also adapt the plan based on some kind of form inputs.
    1. Optimally, I fill out out this form during the initial athlete interview,
    2. The values then become the assumptions for the new plan build structure.
        1. For example, the day off, or the long day. I should be able to input their day off in the form, and then have
            it change which day is the "0 tss" day in their week.
        2. Each of these values should be set to a standard value, and then it stays at whatever I set it to.
            So then when I enter a new form value for only one of the paramters, it doesn't set all the old one's back
            to standard, but instead leaves' the person's current default, except for the value(s) that I just changed.
